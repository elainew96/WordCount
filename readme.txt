This project was initially made for my class (ECS 60) at UC Davis, Winter 2017. 
Gen reads in a .txt file, and outputs the words in the file alphabetically, followed by the number of times it appears and the line(s) that the word appears on.
gen.cpp uses AvlTree and QueueLL, both taken from Weiss's files.
It uses the makefile to compile, and runs using ./gen -.txt

This program was originally written by Elaine Wu and Julius Ramos.
